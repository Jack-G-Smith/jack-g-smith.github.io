# Obojima
Obojima is a Ghibli-inspired setting set on an island which exists simultaneously in the Physical and Spirit Realm, and where magic and semi-modern technology are mutually a part of rural/suburban life. There is no centralized government on the island, and every settlement more or less handles their own affairs.

### Notes from the DM
Just some basic stuff first before getting into the nitty-gritty...
- This is not _my_ adventure, it is _our_ adventure. That means it's possible (and likely) that we'll have plenty of creative twists and turns each session - both planned and unplanned. I encourage everyone to engage with the story in creative and fun ways!
- I want to make sure that every player has time to be included in the group. If you feel like you are being left out or you are finding it hard to enjoy yourself, please speak up! <b>I have the most fun doing this when you all are having fun</b>, so I ask that you do your part in addressing anything that hinders  your enjoyment and I'll try to do the same. You can reach out to me in person or just shoot me a text/call and I will do everything in my power to fix it.
### My expectations:
As the DM, I’m going to be putting a lot of time into prepping this adventure for everyone. This will be a commitment. I just have a few expectations for players that will be joining the campaign:
1. <b>Be present during the sessions.</b> I'm not explicitly banning phones, but I'd really appreciate it if we could all limit their use during sessions. If you’re having trouble with this, let me know if there’s anything that I can do to help.
2. <b>Do not miss more than two sessions every three months</b>. Sessions will be every other Sunday starting at 10:00 am. If you’re going to miss a session, please let me know at least a week in advance.
3. <b>Everyone is inclusive to everyone</b>. If I (or any player) feels uncomfortable, I will do my best to make immediate changes to ensure that the problem is resolved. We are all playing a character, yes, but we are also friends first and foremost. Please remember that.
4. <b>Do not tell another player what their character should be doing</b>. This is not a try-hard campaign where your anime waifu gets to make all the decisions and kill those who don't follow their rules. Everyone is here to play their characters as they want to play them. You will need to work as a team, and everyone must be free to make their own choices.
5. <b>Have Fun!</b> Obojima is a whimsical place with so much to explore. I’m excited to dive into it with you all!

**If you feel like you can’t commit to the expectations above, <i>talk to me</i>. We'll figure out what we need to do to make each session fun for everyone.**

### Session Zero
You will not have to prep a character until session zero, but please have a few backstory ideas in mind! I will provide all character sheets and other things for character creation, but it's much more fun and easy to build a character when you have a story you want to tell!
