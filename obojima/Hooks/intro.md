### **Our Story Begins...**
Our story begins as many do, with an introduction to our main characters! Our first adventure is an introduction to both the world of Obojima and D&D 5th Edition as a whole. You will all start off as children, struggling to find your place in the world. If the concept of playing a child worries you, don't worry! It is only temporary, and simply used as a tool for us to explore the origin of the character you create. We will age everyone up once we wrap up our first adventure. Think of this as a good opportunity to form a completely fresh perspective on an exotic island. Use this first adventure as a mechanism to form your ideals, determine your character flaws, and make lifelong friends/enemies!
