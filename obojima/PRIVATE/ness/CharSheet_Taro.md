### Talents & Traits

| Talent | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **The Paper-Face Trickster** | Taro carries a collection of hand-painted paper masks (a fox, a grumpy old man, a smiling moon). Once per session, she can put one on to perfectly mimic the voice of someone she has heard speaking for at least a minute. |
| **"I Know That Look"** | Taro has **Advantage** on Wisdom (Insight) checks to tell if someone is hiding their true emotions. She can see the "cracks" in other people's masks. |
| **Center of Attention** | Once per session, Taro can perform a "Grand Distraction." Whether it’s a fake tantrum, a beautiful song, or a tall tale, all NPCs within 40 feet have **Disadvantage** on Perception checks to notice anything *other* than Taro for 1 minute. |

### The Treasure Satchel

*These items define how you solve problems. Use them creatively!*

| Treasure | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **A Tin of Spirit-Paints** | These paints never seem to run out, but they only show up clearly on wood or paper—never on skin (unless she's trying to hide a smudge). |
| **The Echo-Stone** | A smooth stone that "records" the last 6 seconds of sound it hears. Taro can throw it or hide it. When she snaps her fingers, the stone plays the sound back at full volume. Perfect for creating a distraction or framing someone for saying something they didn't. |
| **Spirit-Ink Smoke-Bomb** | A small ceramic pot of pressurized ink. When smashed, it creates a **10-foot radius of "Ink-Mist."** For everyone else, it’s a heavily obscured area. For Taro, because she "knows the ink," she can see through it clearly. (2 uses). |
| **The "Magnanimous" Coin** | A gold-plated lead coin that looks incredibly valuable. When Taro gives this to an NPC, they must make a **DC 12 Wisdom Save**. On a failure, they are **Charmed** by Taro for 10 minutes, believing she is a "very important young lady" from a wealthy family. After 10 minutes, the coin turns back into a dull, grey pebble. |

## Backstory: Life at Echo-Chamber Academy

**The Mask Club:** Taro is hyper-aware of her "spirit-ears" in a school full of different ancestries. She has noticed that the Dara students like Mallow don't look at her ears with pity, but with curiosity. However, she still feels the weight of her father's words every time she walks past the Academy's grand mirrors. She has started a "Mask Club" under the guise of an art elective, teaching other students how to paint faces—mostly so she can surround herself with people whose "true" faces are hidden, making her feel less alone in her own disguise. So far no one has joined, but if she can just find one person to join that'd be enough.

## The Secret Behind the Paint


To everyone in the village, Taro’s father is a saint. He is the man who stays late to fix the communal well, the one who carries the heaviest sacks without a word of complaint. He is quiet, reserved, and infinitely kind.

But for Taro, that kindness has always felt like a thin veil. Growing up, she noticed the way his eyes would linger on her ears—the elegant, pointed proof of a heritage her human mother didn't share. She noticed the way he never quite looked her in the eye when he told her he loved her.

The night before Taro set out for Okiiri, the veil tore.

Passing by her father’s room, she heard him speaking to a faded photograph of her mother. His voice wasn't the steady, calm tone the neighbors knew; it was brittle and heavy with a decade of exhaustion.


"She's getting taller," he whispered to the picture. "She has your smile, but she has those... spirit-ears. Every time I see them, I remember the night the light went out of your eyes. I try to be the man you wanted me to be, but looking at her is like looking at the storm that took you away. I’m sorry. I look at our daughter, and all I can see is the reason you aren't here."


Taro didn't stay to hear the rest. She went to her room, picked up her paints, and began working on a new mask. If her father couldn't bear to see her face, she would simply give him a different one to look at.
