### Talents & Traits

| Talent | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **The River’s Shield** | Once per session, when an ally within 5 feet is targeted by an attack or a physical hazard (a falling branch, a splashing puddle, a mean shove), Breeck can use his reaction to interpose himself or a sturdy object. The ally gains a **+2 to their AC** or **Advantage on the Saving Throw**. |
| **The Mender’s Eye** | Breeck has a knack for seeing "how things work" and where they are broken. He has **Advantage** on checks to repair broken objects (toys, wagons, tools) or to identify a non-magical illness or injury in a person or animal. |
| **A Gentle Hand** | Once per long rest, Breeck can spend a few minutes "comforting" a creature (a sad child, a grumpy spirit, or a wounded animal). Roll a **d4**. The target gains that many "Comfort Points" (temporary HP). While they have these points, they are immune to being **Frightened**, as Breeck’s calm presence acts as an emotional anchor. |

## Backstory

**The Grime of Yatamon:** Breeck doesn’t look like the bright, colorful Nakudama you see in travel brochures. Growing up in the "Basement" (the drainage levels of Yatamon), his skin is a more muted, dusky olive, and he often smells faintly of rain-slicked stone and old paper. While other Nakudama might be found in clear ponds, Breeck spent his childhood in the "Hidden River"—the network of canals that runs beneath the city's factories.

**The Lessons of Trapis:** Trapis didn’t teach Breeck how to fight; he taught him how to *endure*. He taught him that when a child is crying, you sit with them until they stop. He taught him that a broken chair is just a puzzle waiting for a solution. When Trapis gave Breeck a walking staff and pointed him toward Okiiri, he said: *"The city has taught you how to survive the dark, Breeck. Now go to Okiiri and see what the light looks like. Then you'll know what's worth protecting."*

**The Pilgrimage Gear:** Breeck is on a pilgrimage from the industrial, semi-modern **Yatamon** to the traditional, spiritual **Okiiri**. He is a "fish out of water" (pun intended). Breeck travels light. He wears a faded, oversized yellow raincoat that Trapis found in a charity bin, and he carries a small satchel containing a wooden bowl, a blunt mending needle, and a single, smooth river stone. He walks with a steady, unhurried pace—the pace of someone who knows exactly how long the road is and isn't afraid of the distance.
