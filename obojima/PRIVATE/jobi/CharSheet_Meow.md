### Talents & Traits

| Talent | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Wild Senses** | Meow has **Advantage** on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to hearing or smelling something hidden in the brush. |
| **Critter Call** | Once per session, Meow can let out a specific chirp or whistle. A small, non-combat animal (a squirrel, a bright blue bird, a fat toad) will appear and perform one simple task: distracting a guard, retrieving a shiny key, pointing the way to water, etc. |
| **The Warmth of Brotherhood** | This simple necklace is made of *sea-glass and a single, unidentifiable tooth*. Once per long rest, when Meow fails a Saving Throw or feels overwhelmed (Fear/Charm), he can squeeze the necklace. The sea-glass glows with a faint, warm light, reminding him he isn't truly alone. He can reroll the save with the memory of his brother’s hand on his shoulder. |
| **Extra-Planar Senses** | Because Meow is a "result," he is more attuned to the shifting boundaries of Obojima. He can tell when the party is crossing from the Physical Realm into the Spirit Realm (or a Blighted zone) because his fur stands on end and the necklace grows cold. |

### The Treasure Satchel

| Treasure | Effect |

| **The Spirit Lens** | An newborn Dara gave this to Meow as a reward for helping him find his imparting glyph. It's a cracked piece of polished amber that can be used to look at "spirit-trails." When Meow looks through it, he can see **magical or spirit footprints** left within the last hour. It gives him expertise (+6) to the *Survival* ability. |
| **Packet of "Snap-Seeds" (3)** | Dried seeds from a Bush-Spirit. Meow can throw one at the ground as a reaction. It explodes into a **5-foot cloud of thick, pungent pollen**. Any creature in the cloud must sneeze (DC 10 Con save or lose their reaction), giving Meow a chance to dash away. (3 uses). |
| **The Whispering Bell** | Tied to his tail or wrist. It doesn't ring for people, but it **tings softly when a Spirit is within 30 feet**, even if that spirit is invisible or hiding in a tree. |

## Backstory

Meow’s family lived in the "Neutral Zone" between two growing settlements: **The Great Pine Village** and a new **Industrial Logging Camp**.

A dispute broke out over who owned the "Result" people living in the woods. One morning, "Men with Metal Voices" (soldiers or city-enforcers) arrived to "relocate" all Tabaxi located between the settlements. In the chaos of the village being dismantled, Meow’s brother, who was older and faster, drew the guards away so Meow could hide in a hollow log.

The last thing Meow saw was his brother being hoisted onto a steam-wagon, the necklace falling into the mud. The wagon headed toward the **Smog-Choked City**, and the border was officially closed that evening. To Meow, it wasn't a war; it was just a group of mean adults taking his hero away for reasons that "didn't make sense."
