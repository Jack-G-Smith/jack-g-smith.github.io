# Obojima: Tales from the Fragile Island

Obojima is a setting where the veil between the Physical and Spirit Realms is whisper-thin. It is a place where rural charm meets 1980s-style technology, and where the balance of nature is maintained not by a central government, but by the communities and guilds that call the island home.

## Geography and Governance

Obojima exists simultaneously in two planes of existence: the **Physical Realm** and the **Spirit Realm**. This overlap causes the natural world to be saturated with magic, resulting in vibrant landscapes and sentient weather patterns.

* **Political Structure:** There is no centralized government or monarchy. Every settlement—from coastal fishing villages to mountain hamlets—is self-governing and handles its own local affairs.
* **The Spirit Realm:** While layered directly over the physical world, entering the Spirit Realm fully is an exceedingly rare and difficult feat, usually requiring specific rituals or accidental thin points in reality.

## The Spirits of Obojima

Spirits are diverse entities that must choose a physical form to interact with the world. Their classification is usually determined by the nature of the form they inhabit. Some spirits may live primarily in the physical realm, while others come and go.

### Spirit Classifications

* **Beast Spirits:** These spirits resemble animals. They often integrate so seamlessly into society that owners may believe they have an ordinary pet, unaware of the spirit's true nature.
* **Flora Spirits:** Spirits that embody plants, trees, or fungi. They act as guardians of the wilderness and often nurture non-spirit plants they consider to be their kin.
* **Elemental Spirits:** Resembling raw natural elements. A common example is the dust bunny, a small spirit that thrives in the corners of homes and is often shaken out of rugs during spring cleaning.
* **Object Spirits:** Spirits that possess and animate inanimate objects. They are drawn to items that hold significant sentimental value or have been handled by many people over time.
* **Spectral Spirits:** These spirits refuse to limit themselves to a physical form. While this grants them freedom, it severely limits their ability to manipulate or touch the Physical Realm.

## Species of the Island

* **Humans:** The primary inhabitants who drive the island's technological integration and guild culture.
* **Elves:** Born from human parents, Elves are individuals who possess a biological and spiritual connection to the Spirit Realm. They are seen as a natural evolution of the human experience on Obojima.
* **Nakudama:** A race of frog-like humanoids. They are among the oldest inhabitants of the island and possess a deep cultural history.
* **Dara:** Mysterious, wooden-skinned folk who emerged from the forests during the current age.
    * **Red Dara:** Small in stature with two eyes.
    * **Blue Dara:** Medium-sized with a single, large eye.

## Timeline of Ages

The history of Obojima is categorized by the arrival or emergence of its various peoples.

1. **The First Age:** An era shrouded in mystery. It was characterized by advanced technology that far exceeds current capabilities.
2. **The Age of Nakudama:** Defined by the arrival and proliferation of the Nakudama across the island.
3. **The Age of Humanity:** Marked by the arrival of humans and the subsequent birth of the first Elves.
4. **The Age of Dara (Current Era):** The present age, beginning when the Dara people wandered out from the woodwork of the island's deep forests.

## First Age Technology and Magic

Modern life on Obojima utilizes reclaimed technology from the First Age, which resembles the aesthetics of the late 20th century (1980s).

* **Integration:** Magic and spirits act as the primary power source for this technology. A spirit might inhabit a device to power its battery or provide the energy needed for a cassette player to function.
* **Limitations:** While the inhabitants can repair and occasionally replicate minor devices, the high-level engineering of the First Age remains largely a lost art.

## Major Factions

Order is maintained through various guilds and institutions that operate across the island's many independent settlements.

### Social and Professional Guilds

* **AHA (Guild of Archeologists, Historians, and Archivists):** A scholarly organization dedicated to the recovery and preservation of First Age artifacts and island history.
* **Courier Brigade:** A high-risk delivery service that ensures mail and supplies reach even the most remote or dangerous corners of the island.
* **Mariners’ Guild:** An organization focused on maritime exploration, defense against hostile sea creatures, and navigation.
* **Society of Young Stewards:** A youth-focused organization that teaches survival skills, community service, and environmental stewardship.
* **Witch Covens:** Small, local groups that focus on the DIY aspects of magic, specifically potion-brewing and the crafting of everyday spells.

### The Four Sword Schools

Martial prowess is preserved through four distinct schools of swordsmanship, each with its own philosophy:

| School | Style Philosophy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Canden & Moon** | Traditional, disciplined, and focused on Lawful-Good ideals. |
| **Lom & Salt** | Pragmatic and focused on the Build-Your-Own-Sword mentality. |
| **Tellu & Scale** | Fluid and adaptive, focusing on intuition and individual vibes. |
| **Toraf & Boulder** | A rugged, Anything-Goes style that prioritizes strength and durability. |
